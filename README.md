# restcountries-and-weather-api

This project fetches data from the Rest Countries API and displays information about various countries, including their name, flag, capital, region, and country code. Additionally, it allows users to fetch and display current weather information for each country using the OpenWeatherMap API.

- Displays country name, flag, capital, region, and country code.
